# Learning Algorithms

My working repository to learn data structures and algorithms. Includes important notes to help review some concepts tp brush up.

## Data Structures

## Sorting

Elementary Sorts:

1. Insertion Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Shell Sort

### Stability in Sorting
A stable sort is one where, in the event of two equal keys, we maintain the original order.

| Sorting Algorithm | Stability |
| --- | --- |
| Insertion Sort | Stable |
| Selection Sort | Not Stable |
| Shell Sort | Not Stable |
| Merge Sort | Stable |
